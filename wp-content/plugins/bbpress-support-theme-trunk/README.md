## Usage

To use the [supportforums](https://github.com/Automattic/bbpress-support-theme/tree/trunk/supportforums) theme for your project, use it in combination with the [supportforums-oss](https://github.com/Automattic/bbpress-support-theme/tree/trunk/supportforums-oss) child theme. It's an example child theme which can be modified according to your needs while not having to modify the main parent theme.
