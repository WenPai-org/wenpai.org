Allows you to easily upgrade for testing the next versions of WordPress.

## Description
This plugin provides an easy way to get involved with beta testing WordPress.

Once installed it will enable you to upgrade your website to the latest Nightly, Beta, or Release Candidate at the click of a button using the built in upgrader.

By default once enabled it switches your website onto the point release development track.

For the more adventurous there is the option to switch to the bleeding edge (trunk) of development.

Don't forget to backup before you start!

Please enable auto-updates for this plugin to ensure future changes are properly handled with core updates.

### Extra Settings

There is a setting to **Skip successful autoupdate emails**. It functions to disable sending emails to the admin user for successful autoupdates. Only emails indicating failures of the autoupdate process are sent.
