### Personalize the Admin Dashboard

Branda puts you in control of rearranging and customizing the WordPress dashboard. Use your brand colors and display your logo in place of the WordPress icon. Create custom menus and the widget areas. Easily add a favicon. Create help links that are actually helpful and integrate a contact link that points to you.

### Login Page Customization

Branda includes pre-designed login screen templates for quickly transforming your Login screen. Add your own logo, a custom background image, style input fields, adjust opacity, and configure drop shadows, colors and default settings. Give your visitors, staff, and other users a login page that matches your branding.

> “The Branda plugin is a total solution. Customize login, the admin section, and more. It’s by the folks at WPMU DEV, which means it is Multisite ready and will always be up-to-date with great support.” - [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-white-label-the-wordpress-dashboard)

> “Branda makes it feel like the whole job is much more custom and it takes just a couple extra minutes.” - [Adam Teece](https://wpmudev.com/profile/successfulgeek/)

### Website Under Construction!

If your website is coming soon, under construction or down for routine maintenance, Branda has you covered with Maintenance Mode & Coming Soon pages. Start and continue building your brand and reputation with public-facing landing pages and custom WordPress maintenance mode pages that connect people to your brand while you get things ready in the background.

### Cookies and GDPR

Looking for a way to add cookie notices to your site? Activate Branda’s Cookie notice tool, style your notification, and a cookie notice opt-in will display across your site. Branda helps you do your part.

### White Label System Emails

WordPress system emails are pretty basic by default. With Branda, you can add your own HTML templates to your system emails. You can also set the “from” email address for outgoing emails, and if your emails are ending up in the trash, switch to SMTP.

### Analytics Tracking Codes

Branda’s Tracking Codes module lets you easily insert tracking codes into your website. Insert codes at different locations such as within the head tag, after the opening body tag or before the closing body tag. There is also an option to insert the code on the whole website or insert it conditionally.

### Customize your Database Error Page

With Branda, you can add your own message, logo, and styles to the DB error page. The “Error Establishing a Database Connection” page is not pretty, give it some style.

### Import/Export

Customize your dashboard just once, export and move it to all your websites with the Branda Import and Export tool. Think of all the time you’ll save giving your agency sites a consistent look and feel. 

### White Label Multisite

Branda can be used to white label all the sites across an entire network! Use global settings or configure each site individually. Branda has Multisite-specific customizations that make it easy to make a network yours from front to back.

### This is How you White Label WordPress

Branda is super easy to use – no confusing settings and [fully documented](https://wpmudev.com/docs/wpmu-dev-plugins/branda/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=branda-readme&utm_content=fully_documented).
