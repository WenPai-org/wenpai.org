Mistape allows readers to effortlessly notify site staff about found spelling errors.

== Description ==
Strive to keep your content flawless? Mistape will help!

Let your readers notify you about spelling mistakes they may encounter. Make them feel attentive and helpful, and show your care fixing reported errors.

On Ctrl+Enter event, the plugin sends selected text along with paragraph and page URL it belongs to an email address selected in admin settings page. You can choose among administrators and editors, or specify another address.

The plugin is very lightweight. The "press Ctrl+Enter..." caption (or your text) can be configured to be automatically appended to selected post types or be inserted anywhere using a shortcode. Disabled features don't get loaded, so performance impact is minimized to the lowest notch.
Besides text, caption also can be set as image defined by URL.

Mistape is full of hooks enabling you to modify its behavior the way you like.

You can easily customize plugin in your colors and chose one from the icons near to the message in posts.

== Installation ==
1. Look up "Mistape" and and install it from plugins section of your site's admin area. Alternatively, download zip from WordPress.org Plugin Directory and extract its contents to wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Activate and follow the settings link in the notice you will see at the top. Tick desired checkboxes, save, and that's it!

All settings are stored in a single database entry and get wiped on plugin uninstall, so you can be sure your WP installation won't be clogged if you decide you don't want Mistape anymore (and we're sure you won't :) ).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've successfully received a few emails and then Mistape stopped working. Why? =
Mistape implements spam-protection checks. A visitor cannot submit more than five reports in 5-minute time frame (per IP address). All subsequent reports are ignored until timeout.
So if Mistape seems to fail sending emails, and you want to test it once more, use a different internet connection, ask your friend to report something, or just wait a few minutes.

= Mistape doesn't seem to work on Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browser. Why ? =
Yes, since version 1.0.6 Mistape doesn't render itself if visitor's device is detected as a mobile device, and since 1.1.0 it ignores Internet Explorer and Edge completely (IE support might be added later).

= Can I customize text and style of the caption? =
Yes, hooks are available for that.

= Can I customize the appearance of confirmation dialog? =
Currently no, as this is a bit more complex feature, and plugin is light and robust.
Though, it may be implemented if there is demand. CSS styling is possible, of course.

= There is no support for my language. How to change the text users see? =
"Press Ctrl+Enter" caption can be customized in settings since version 1.0.3. The rest of strings can be translated using hooks.
We are open for contributions. If you send us a translation file (there are only about 80 strings to translate), we will give you credit in plugin description :).
