Display a custom field as a block on the front end. It supports custom fields for posts, terms, and users. It supports ACF fields explicitly.

== Description ==

This single-block plugin allows you to display a meta field or a custom field as a block on the front end. It supports custom fields for posts, terms, and users. It can be nested inside a parent block that has `postId` and `postType` context, such as `Query Block`, or used as a stand-alone block.

You can display any field whose value can be retrieved by the core API ([get_post_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/), [get_term_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/), [get_user_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_user_meta/)) and is a string or can be converted to a string. To display the field value in the Block Editor, it has to be accessible via the REST API or have the field type set to `dynamic`.

You can also display custom fields created by the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin explicitly. It supports all [ACF field types](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/#field-types) whose values are strings or can be converted to strings. Some other complex fields such as Image, Link, Page Link, True False, Checkbox, Select, Radio, Button Group, Taxonomy, User, Post Object and Relationship field types are also supported in basic formats.

This plugin also provides developer-friendly hook APIs that allow you to easily customize the output of the block, display complex data type fields, or use the block as a placeholder to display any kind of content with `object_id` and `object_type` as context parameters.

An edge case where this block is really helpful is when you need to get the correct `post_id` in your shortcode when you use it in a Query Loop. In that case, you can set the field type as `dynamic` and input your shortcode in the field name. The block will display it correctly on both the front end and the editor. Alternatively, if you only want to see the preview of your shortcode in the editor, you can also use this block as a better version of the `core/shortcode`.

= What is the HTML output of a custom field? =

The HTML output of a custom field on the front end depends on the context of the field. It uses one of these core API functions to get the field value: [get_post_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/), [get_term_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/), [get_user_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_user_meta/).

= What is the HTML output of ACF fields? =

1. All basic field types that return strings or can cast to strings are supported - The HTML output is from the `get_field` function.

2. Link type - The HTML output is:

        <a href={url} target={target} rel="noreferrer noopener">{title}</a>

    There is no `rel` attribute if the `target` is not `_blank`

3. Image type - The HTML output is from the [wp_get_attachment_image](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image/) function. The image size is from the Preview Size setting.

4. True / False type - The HML output is `Yes` if the value is `true`, and `No` if the value is `false`. Below is the code snippet to change these text values:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_acf_field_true_false_on_text', function ( $on_text, $field, $post_id, $value ) {
          return 'Yep';
        }, 10, 4 );

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_acf_field_true_false_off_text', function ( $off_text, $field, $post_id, $value ) {
          return 'Noop';
        }, 10, 4 );

5. Checkbox / Select type - The HTML output is:

        <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>, <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>

    The `item_value` can be either `value` or `label`, depending on the return format of the field. Multiple selected values are separated by `, `. Below is the code snippet to change the separator:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_acf_field_choice_item_separator', function ( $separator, $value, $field, $post_id ) {
          return ' | ';
        }, 10, 4 );

5. Radio button / Button group type - The HTML output can be either `value` or `label`, depending on the return format of the field.

6. Page link type, Post object type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
        </ul>

7. Relationship type - The HTML output is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
        </ul>

8. Taxonomy type - The HTML output is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
        </ul>

9. User type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a></li>
          <li><a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a></li>
        </ul>

10. For other complex field types, you can generate a custom HTML output by using the hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', $field_value, $post_id, $field, $raw_value, $object_type )

    Or by using the general hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', $content, $attributes, $block, $object_id, $object_type )


= Copy & paste snippets =

When using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook to customize block content, we recommend selecting `dynamic` as the field type. This way, both the front end and the editor will show the changes. If you are working with ACF Fields, we suggest using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook to modify the field content.

1. How to change the HTML output of the block?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id, $object_type ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = 'new content';
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 5);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value, $object_type ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = 'new content';
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 5);

    This basic snippet is very powerful. You can use it to display any fields from any posts, terms, users or setting fields. Please see the details in the below use cases.

2. How to wrap the block with a link to the post within the Query Loop?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name && $block_content !== '' ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<a href="%1$s">%2$s</a>', get_permalink($post_id), $block_content);
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name && $block_content !== '' ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<a href="%1$s">%2$s</a>', get_permalink($post_id), $block_content);
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    This snippet only works with the block that has only HTML inline tags or an image.

3. How to display an image URL field as an image tag?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_image_url_field_name' === $field_name && wp_http_validate_url($block_content) ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<img src="%1$s" alt="your_image_url_field_name" />', esc_attr($block_content));
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_image_url_field_name' === $field_name && wp_http_validate_url($block_content) ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<img src="%1$s" alt="your_image_url_field_name" />', esc_attr($block_content));
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

4. How to display multiple meta fields in a block?
    For example, we need to display the full name of a user from two meta fields `first_name` and `last_name`.

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'full_name' === $field_name ) {
            $first_name = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'first_name', true );
            $last_name  = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'last_name', true );

            // If the meta fields are ACF Fields. The code will be:
            // $first_name = get_field( 'first_name', $post_id );
            // $last_name  = get_field( 'last_name', $post_id );

            $block_content = trim("$first_name $last_name");
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Choose the field type as `dynamic` and input the field name as `full_name`.

5. How to display a setting field?
    For example, we need to display a setting field named `footer_credit` on the footer template part of the site.

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          // Replace `footer_credit` with your unique name.
          if ( 'footer_credit' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = get_option( 'footer_credit', '' );

            // If the field is an ACF Field. The code will be:
            // $block_content = get_field( 'footer_credit', 'option' );
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

6. [How to use MFB as a placeholder to display any kind of content?](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-use-mfb-to-display-dynamic-fields/)

= SAVE YOUR TIME WITH MFB PRO =

To display simple data type fields for posts, terms, and users, you only need the free version of MFB. MFB Pro can save you 90% of development time when working with ACF complex fields. It achieves this by transforming your ACF complex field types into container blocks, which work similarly to core container blocks. This eliminates the need for creating ACF custom blocks or writing custom code for displaying ACF complex fields.
Below is a video tutorial on how to use MFB Pro to build a post template without coding

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who needs this plugin? =

This plugin is created for developers, but end users can also use it.

= Does it support inputting and saving meta value? =

No, It does not. It only displays meta fields as blocks.

= Does it support all types of meta fields? =

Only simple types such as string, integer, or number can be used directly. Other complex types such as object, array need to be converted to HTML markup strings.

= Does it support all types of ACF fields? =

It supports all basic field types that return strings or cast to strings. Some complex field types like image, link, page_link, post_object, relationship, taxonomy, and user are also supported in a basic format. To display complex ACF field types such as Group, Repeater, Flexible Content, Gallery, File, etc., you will need to either purchase [MFB PRO](https://metafieldblock.com/pro?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=MFB%20Pro) or write your own custom code using the hook API.

= What are the prefix and suffix for? =

The value for those settings should be plain text or some allowed HTML elements. Their values will be formatted with `wp_kses( $prefix, wp_kses_allowed_html( "post" ) )`. They're helpful for some use cases like displaying the name of the meta field or a value with a prefix or suffix, e.g. $100, 100px, etc.

= Does it include some style for the meta field? =

The block does not provide any CSS style for the meta field value. But it does provide a basic display inline style from the settings.

= Does it support other meta-field frameworks? =

Yes, it does, as long as those meta fields can be accessed via the `get_post_meta`, or `get_term_meta`, or `get_user_meta` function and the return value is a string or can be cast to a string. To display the value in the block editor, the meta field has to be accessed via the REST API.

= What if the displayed markup is blank or is different from the meta value?

There is a chance that your meta value contains some HTML tags or HTML attributes that are not allowed to be displayed. To fix this, you should use the hook `apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_kses_allowed_html', $allowed_html_tags )` to add your tags and attributes to the array of allowed tags. By default, the block allows all tags from the `$allowedposttags` value and basic attributes for `iframe` and `SVG` elements.
