--TEST--
A root requirement for a name exists as well as a dependency's requirement for the same name but in a different version.
The root requirement is satisfied by the actual package by that name in that version. The dependency's requirement can
be satisfied by another package which provides the name in the other version. This will result in all packages being
installed as the provider does not conflict with the actual package and all requirements can be met.
