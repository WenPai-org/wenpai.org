A fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress.

== Description ==
ElasticPress, a fast and flexible search and query engine for WordPress, enables WordPress to find or “query” relevant content extremely fast through a variety of highly customizable features. WordPress out-of-the-box struggles to analyze content relevancy and can be very slow. ElasticPress supercharges your WordPress website making for happier users and administrators. The plugin even contains features for popular plugins.

Here is a list of the amazing ElasticPress features included in the plugin:

__Search__: Instantly find the content you’re looking for. The first time.

__Instant Results__: A built for WordPress search experience that bypasses WordPress for optimal performance. Instant Results routes search queries through a dedicated API, separate from WordPress, returning results up to 10x faster than previous versions of ElasticPress.

__WooCommerce__: With ElasticPress, filtering WooCommerce product results is fast and easy. Your customers can find and buy exactly what they're looking for, even if you have a large or complex product catalog.

__Related Posts__: ElasticPress understands data in real time, so it can instantly deliver engaging and precise related content with no impact on site performance.

__Protected Content__: Optionally index all of your content, including private and unpublished content, to speed up searches and queries in places like the administrative dashboard.

__Documents__: Indexes text inside of popular file types, and adds those files types to search results.

__Autosuggest__: Suggest relevant content as text is entered into the search field.

__Filters__: Add controls to your website to filter content by one or more taxonomies.

__Comments__: Indexes your comments and provides a widget with type-ahead search functionality. It works with WooCommerce product reviews out-of-the-box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ElasticPress work? =

The ElasticPress plugin enables you to connect your WordPress site to the ElasticPress.io service, a SaaS solution that provides an enhanced search experience while reducing load on your WordPress site. For advanced users familiar with both WordPress and Elasticsearch hosting and management, ElasticPress also offers support for plugin functionality using an Elasticsearch instance. Please keep in mind that there are multiple security, performance, and configuration considerations to take into account if you take this approach.

= I have to use an in-house or custom Elasticsearch solution due to policy or institutional requirements. Can you still help? =

If circumstances prevent the use of a SaaS solution like ElasticPress.io, we can also provide [consulting](https://www.elasticpress.io/elasticpress-consulting/) around installation and configuration of custom Elasticsearch instances.

= Where can I find ElasticPress documentation and user guides? =

Please refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress) for detailed usage instructions and documentation. FAQs and tutorials can be also found on our [support site](https://www.elasticpress.io/documentation/).

= I have a problem with the plugin. Where can I get help? =

If you have identified a bug or would like to suggest an enhancement, please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress). We do not provide support here at WordPress.org forums.

If you are an ElasticPress.io customer, please open a ticket in your account dashboard. If you need a custom solution, we also offer [consulting](https://www.elasticpress.io/elasticpress-consulting/).

= Where do I report security bugs? =

You can report any security bugs found in the source code of ElasticPress through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/elasticpress). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment and take care of notifying the developers of this plugin.

= Is ElasticPress compatible with OpenSearch or Elasticsearch X.Y? =

ElasticPress requirements can be found in the [Requirements section](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress#requirements) of our GitHub repository. If your solution relies on a different server or version, you may find additional information on our [Compatibility documentation page](https://10up.github.io/ElasticPress/tutorial-compatibility.html).

= 5.0.0 - 2023-11-01 =

**ElasticPress 5.0.0 contains some important changes. Make sure to read these highlights before upgrading:**

* This version does not require a full reindex but it is recommended, especially for websites using synonyms containing spaces.
* Meta keys are not indexed by default anymore. The new Weighting Dashboard allows admin users to mark meta fields as indexables. The new `ep_prepare_meta_allowed_keys` filter allows to add meta keys programmatically.
* Features now have their fields declared in JSON. Custom features may need to implement the `set_settings_schema()` method to work.
* The `Users` feature was moved to the [ElasticPress Labs](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPressLabs) plugin and is no longer available in this plugin. If you use this feature, make sure to install and configure EP Labs before upgrading.
* The `Terms` and `Comments` features are now hidden by default for sites that do not have them active yet. Check [our blog post](https://www.elasticpress.io/blog/2023/03/enabling-comments-and-terms-in-elasticpress-5-0) for more info.
