## Description

LLMs.txt for WP is a WordPress plugin designed to generate machine-learning-friendly content from your site. It automatically creates an `llms.txt` file that compiles key content in a standardized format, making your site ready for Large Language Models (LLMs), which can help make your content more discoverable and useful for AI tools and applications.

Additionally, this plugin allows you to easily access **Markdown versions of your posts** by appending `.md` to the post URLs.

### Key Features

- **Generate llms.txt**: Aggregate key content from your site into an easy-to-read format for machine learning models.
- **Markdown Support**: Generate Markdown versions of posts, suitable for LLMs and for those who prefer plain text or wish to share content in a lightweight format.
- **Fully Customizable**: Customize which page or posts should be included via the admin settings page.
