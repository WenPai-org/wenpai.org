== Installation ==

Secure your website using the following steps to install Wordfence:

1. Install Wordfence automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. 
2. Activate the Wordfence through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Wordfence is now activated.
3. Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.
4. Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.
5. Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.
6. Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.
7. Click the "Live Traffic" menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.

To install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:

1. Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
2. Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears. 
3. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site's menu. 
4. Go to the "Scan" menu and start your first scan. 
5. Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. 
6. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. 
7. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you're accessing the system.

= Do I need a security plugin like Wordfence if I’m using a cloud based firewall (WAF)? =

Wordfence provides true endpoint security for your WordPress website. Unlike cloud based firewalls, Wordfence executes within the WordPress environment, giving it knowledge like whether the user is signed in, their identity and what access level they have. Wordfence uses the user’s access level in more than 80% of the firewall rules it uses to protect WordPress websites. Learn more about the [Cloud WAF identity problem here](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/endpoint-vs-cloud-security-cloud-waf-user-identity-problem/). Additionally, cloud based firewalls can be bypassed, leaving your site exposed to attackers. Because Wordfence is an integral part of the endpoint (your WordPress website), it can’t be bypassed. Learn more about the [Cloud WAF bypass problem here](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/endpoint-vs-cloud-security-cloud-waf-bypass-problem/). To fully protect the investment you’ve made in your website you need to employ a defense in depth approach to security. Wordfence takes this approach.

= Will Wordfence slow down my website? =

No. Wordfence Security is extremely fast and uses techniques like caching its own configuration data to avoid database lookups and blocking malicious attacks that would slow down your site.

= What if my site has already been hacked? =

Wordfence Security is able to repair core files, themes and plugins on sites where security is already compromised. You can follow this guide on [how to clean a hacked website using Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/). If you are cleaning your own site after a hack, note that site security cannot be assured unless you do a full reinstall if your site has been hacked. We recommend you only use Wordfence Security to get your site into a running state in order to recover the data you need to do a full reinstall. If you need help with a security issue, check out [Wordfence Care](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-care/), which offers hands-on support from our team, including dealing with a hacked site. For mission-critical sites, check out [Wordfence Response](https://www.wordfence.com/products/wordfence-response/).

= Does Wordfence Security support IPv6? =

Yes. We fully support IPv6 with all security functions including country blocking, range blocking, city lookup, whois lookup and all other security functions. If you are not running IPv6, Wordfence will work great on your site too. We are fully compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 whether you run both or only one addressing scheme.

= Does Wordfence Security support Multi-Site installations? =

Yes. WordPress Multi-Site is fully supported. Using Wordfence you can scan every blog in your network for malware with one click. If one of your customers posts a page or post with a known malware URL that threatens your whole domain with being blocklisted by Google, we will alert you in the next scan.
