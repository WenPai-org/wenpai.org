Hello,

I encountered an issue with the following code:
<!--
    ⚠️ Your code below (not the code from inside Carbon library)
    Be sure it's dependency-free and enough to reproduce the issue
    when we run it on:
    https://play.phpsandbox.io/embed/nesbot/carbon
-->
```php
echo Carbon::parse('2018-06-01')->subDay()->month;
```

Carbon version: **PUT HERE YOUR CARBON VERSION (exact version, not the range)**
<!--
    ⚠️ Run the command `composer show nesbot/carbon` to get "versions"
-->

PHP version: **PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION**

<!--
    Use `echo phpversion();`
    to get PHP version.

    Some issues can depends on your context, settings,
    macros, timezone, language. So to be sure the code
    you give is enough to reproduce your bug, try it
    first in:
    https://play.phpsandbox.io/embed/nesbot/carbon?input=%3C%3Fphp%0A%0Aecho%20Carbon%3A%3Aparse('2018-06-01')-%3EsubDay()-%3Emonth%3B

    You can use the [Options] button to change the version
    then when you get the bug with this editor, you can use
    the [Export] button, copy the link of the opened tab,
    then paste it in the issue. Then we can immediately get
    your issue.

I expected to get:

```
6
```
<!--
    Always give your expectations. Each use has their owns.
    You may want daylight saving time to be taken into account,
    someone else want it to be ignored. You may want timezone
    to be used in comparisons, someone else may not, etc.
-->

But I actually get:

```
5
```
<!--
    If you did not succeed to get the same result in
    https://play.phpsandbox.io/embed/nesbot/carbon?input=%3C%3Fphp%0A%0Aecho%20Carbon%3A%3Aparse('2018-06-01')%3B then precise the
    result you get.
-->

Thanks!
