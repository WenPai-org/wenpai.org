Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires requirer/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by requirer/pkg[1.0.0].
    - requirer/pkg 1.0.0 requires dependency/pkg 1.0.0 -> found dependency/pkg[1.0.0] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (2.*).
