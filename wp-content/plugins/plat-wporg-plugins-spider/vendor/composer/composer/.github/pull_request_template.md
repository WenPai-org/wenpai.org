<!-- Please remember to select the appropriate branch:

For bug fixes pick the oldest branch where the fix applies (e.g. `2.4` if that version is affected, `1.10` if it is a critical fix that should be fixed in Composer 1, otherwise `main`)

For new features and everything else, use the main branch. -->
