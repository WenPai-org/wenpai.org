--TEST--
When filtering packages from the pool that cannot meet the fixed/locked requirements, ensure that the requirements for a package that is not required anywhere is not used to filter, as it will be ultimately be removed.
(The locked third/pkg is not required by any package so will be removed, so should not restrict the versions of fourth/pkg)
